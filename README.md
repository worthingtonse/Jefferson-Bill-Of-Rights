Jefferson-Bill-Of-Rights
========================

We the Humans have evolved with certain adaptations, abilities, instincts, and behaviors that provide us with natural advantages in our environment. Among these are the abilities to communicate, cooperate, use tools and instincts to live and live well - let us call these adaptations our natural rights, human rights, genetic rights or simply our rights. 

Important traits that we have evolved with include our opposable thumbs, vocal cords and large brains. These endowments were inherited from our parents and ultimately from God or as a phenomenon of the natural universe.

    These natural rights are inalienable ( cannot be separated from us). Even if we should have our tongues cut from our mouths -by force - we will still possess the just-claim to communicate because the  genes to communicate are sequenced in every DNA chain in every single cell in our bodies.[1]
    
Therefor our rights came before there were governments, constitutions or laws and our rights are a direct result of our biology and millions of years of evolution. We the Homo sapiens have obtained all our rights simply by being born human. 

We are all equal in our claim to our own natural rights. Every member of our species, short or tall, smart or simpleminded, has a just-claim to seek out the best for them, and use their parent-given genetic rights to try to achieve their goals and pursue happiness independently. Within the human population there is much genetic diversity. Males and Females have different chromosomes and each person will have unique genetics based on their unique ancestry.  With few exceptions [2] the pursuit of happiness and our rights are not related to our race, gender, sexuality or religion. Because of our diversity, Humans may not succeed equality - but all people have the right to pursue happiness in an environment where institution do not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color or ethnicity.
 
Our rights are self-evident meaning that they are obvious to us because we are humans and we experience life in our bodies every day. We know what it means to be human, our needs, wants, our desires and our human skills that help us reach our goals. 
 
However, in the modern age, humans are our own worst enemy. The history of mankind is a history of war, death and carnage. History has shown that when humans control other humans, those people being controlled do not live long.  Humans will often deny each other's rights in order to further their own welfare or force their beliefs of how humans should behave upon others. Humans often suppress the rights of other humans in order to achieve their own selfish goals.  Even when humans have good intentions they may inadvertently take the rights of others thinking that it is righteous, fair, equitable or scientific.

 However, freedom provides the possibility of failure and freedom is necessary for human happiness and the long term evolution of our species. That is why it is ethical and good to make certain that no other humans are given control of our lives - and that we may be independent and live on our own terms, free to fail and always in control of ourselves. Simply put I have no more right to control your life as you have right to control mine. 
 
    We the humans have the right to institute governments to protect us from the human tendency to dominate, enslave, coerce, cannibalize, socialize, and even murder other humans. Humans will dissolve governments that do not protect rights, liberty and individual sovereignty as well as those governments that seek to tax, control and in-dept the people they claim to own.   
[1] If you do not believe in human evolution then you may simply substitute that your rights have been bestowed upon you by the designs of your god(s) -the most powerful force in the universe.  

[2] Women have the natural right to give birth while men do not. Europeans have the natural right to tan while many Africans do not have that natural right.
