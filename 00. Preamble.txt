We hold these statements to be true:

 That we are born with adaptations and biological features including vocal cords, thumbs, brains, and instincts that taken together are uniquely human; and, 
 
 That nature selects traits that give advantages to a species, and these traits are passed to offspring - or - God has bestowed upon us traits that we are designed to use; and,
 
We Humans universally prefer to control our own lives and exercise our rights without obstruction, and,

We are all equal in our humanity and governments are fictitious entities of humans, by humans and for humans ; 

Therefor we declare:  

That the use of vocal cords, thumbs, brains, and instincts give us humans a natural advantage to survive within our environment. and, 

That we must use these adaptations because we would not have evolved with them if we didn’t require them for survival - or God bestowed these features on us for us to use and therefore we have a just-claim to employ these properties; and,  

 Let us call these biological features that give humans natural advantages Natural Rights, Human Rights or simply Rights. and,
 
That we are all equal in our humanity and that Person X has no more right to infringe on the rights of Person Y then Person Y has the Right to infringe on Person X regardless if one should be elected into - or employed by - governments.

Let’s enumerate the most important rights so that governments can be better restricted from infringing upon them.
