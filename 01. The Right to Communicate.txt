The Right to Communicate:
a. Humans are communicators by nature and must communicate for survival. We have a just-claim to communicate and employ communication technologies freely and privately. It is inhumane to suppress, monitor, collect or intercept communications without consent of the communicators. This does not apply to government agents operating in public with no expectation of privacy.
