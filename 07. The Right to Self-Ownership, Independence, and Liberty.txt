The Right to Self-Ownership, Independence, and Liberty
a. We have a just-claim to self-ownership with all associated privileges and responsibilities of independent peoples. Labor, consumption, marriage, sexuality, offspring, medical treatment, death and drug use are some of the areas in which people have the right to determine their own actions -without government interference – and live with the consequences. Slavery, serfdom, prejudicial taxation, punitive taxation, excessive taxation and forced debt repayment are absolutely inhumane. The right to Bankruptcy shall not be denied. The institutions of prostitution, gambling, marriage, assisted suicide, drug use, shall not be prohibited. Union membership completely voluntary. People shall not be required to have prescriptions for the purchase of medication for adult personal use nor seek out medical or other caregivers who have received monopolistic powers from the state via licensure.
